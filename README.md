# Tinker-CAD---Motion-Detector
So satisfying to watch the logic come alive in Tinkercad—every wire, gate, and component snapping into place. There  is this quiet excitement when the simulation runs and you can see the idea actually work, not just imagine it.

This Tinkercad model explores sound generation by varying frequency using electronic components.

The simulation visually and audibly demonstrates how frequency changes affect sound output, making digital sound concepts intuitive and easy to understand.
